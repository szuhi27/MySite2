            I am a 24 year old Hungarian guy. In high school, I was in a class specialized in math and graduated with excellent grades.
            Continued my education at the University of Debrecen to study Computer Science and got my Bachelors in 2023.<br />
            Since then I spent my time improving my skills in different subjects, mainly focusing on my dream of having my own game developer studio.
            So far I published one game, World of Agriculture and currently working on my second game, which is soon to be finished.

            My non-technical strengths are problem-solving, creativity and logical thinking.
            My favorite part of software development is designing, coming up with how the software looks and runs.
            I am most experienced with C# (from using Unity), but I can learn fast if a "new" language comes up.<br />
            Besides programming I'm interested in data science, economics and all kinds of sciences, I like to learn and develop new skills.

                        <p>My first complete game was made with the Unity engine as my thesis project and my first attempt to become a game developer. It was published on Android as a free game. With this project, I learned a lot about software and game development.</p>
