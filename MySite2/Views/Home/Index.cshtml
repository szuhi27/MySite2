            Hello! Welcome to my site, this should serve as an extended resume, a more detailed look into my work. So <span class="cyan-text">About me</span> ...  I'm a 23 y.o guy from Hungary hopefully, a successful game developer in the future. My main strengths are problem-solving, creativity and logical thinking. My favorite part of software development is the designing part both on back and front end, thinking about how the software looks and runs. I am most experienced with C#, coming from game development in Unity, but I think I can learn fast if a "new" language comes up. Besides programming I'm interested in data science, economics and all kinds of sciences, I like to learn and develop new skills.

                    <p>My first complete game was made with the Unity engine as my thesis project and my first attempt to become a game developer. It was published on Android as a free game. With this project, I learned a lot about software and game development.</p>

                    <p>Currently working on a 2.5D semi-turn-based roguelite game with Unity. It is set in a dark fantasy universe with a unique graphic style. It is currently in early development but I have great hopes for this game, I think it has a big potential.</p>
