        <p>Made my first complete game towards the end of university. I used Unity, C#, .NET, JSON and, for the graphics, GIMP. W.o.A is a 2D agricultural manager game published on Android as a free game. I have learned and improved a lot with this project.</p>

        <h4 class="cyan-text">ActivityManager</h4>
        <p>I made a software to record activities, where you can start an activity, and stop it when it ends, and the program calculates the length of the activity. First I made it with Unity, then as a C# console application and finally as an ASP.NET Core web app. The first two times I used JSON as storage, and EF Core (SQL) was used for the web app. I made it to practice programming and also to see the differences between different methods.</p>

            <p>A Windows Forms application, my first bigger C# project. It was for a university class which was held by NI. My programming skills were not so good at the time, but I got praise for my UI design. This was the first game where I had to implement some kind of computer enemy it was a simple one but I think the gameplay is good.</p>

            <p>Currently working on a 2.5D semi-turn-based roguelite game with Unity. It is set in a dark fantasy universe with a unique graphic style. It is currently in early development but I have great hopes for this game, I think it has a big potential.</p>
