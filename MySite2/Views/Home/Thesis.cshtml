            <p>I was always interested in games, been playing since a young age. That is the reason why I studied Computer Science and I knew I wanted to write my thesis on this topic. Because of the size of the topic, I narrowed it down to mobile games but still, it had a lot of things to write about. Also, I already had the idea of World of Agriculture in my head so it was a perfect topic for me, this way I have my game and I can have my thesis too. With all this, I could start work and get closer to my diploma. </p>

            <h4 class="cyan-text">The content</h4>
            <p>I had two main goals with my thesis, first to show the state of mobile game development, and how the big companies do it. Secondly to demonstrate the development process of a mobile game through the three main stages, planning, programming and publishing. Throughout the paper, I compared my process to real-life examples from industry-defining companies. A big part of the planning stage was the comparison of iOS and Android to see what they offer for how much, and also to figure out for myself where would I publish my game. For better visuals, I created graphs and also included my handwritten notes as images. </p>

            <p>I enjoyed writing my thesis, I always liked writing stories and this was something like that. Furthermore, I learned a lot with this, firstly about development with Unity and programming as a whole, and secondly about the game industry. I made a detailed description of the mobile game market and the practices of leading companies, I even went into VR/AR a bit. So I got a thesis which I got the best grade for and also I have a published game that is available on the market, and I started my game/software developer journey.</p>
