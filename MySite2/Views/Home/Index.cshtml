            I am a 24 year old Hungarian guy. In high school, I was in a class specialized in math and graduated with excellent grades.
            Continued my education at the University of Debrecen to study Computer Science and got my Bachelors in 2023.<br />
            Since then I spent my time improving my skills in different subjects, mainly focusing on my dream of having my own game developer studio.
            So far I published one game, World of Agriculture and currently working on my second game, which is soon to be finished.

            My non-technical strengths are problem-solving, creativity and logical thinking.
            My favorite part of software development is designing, coming up with how the software looks and runs.
            I am most experienced with C# (from using Unity), but I can learn fast if a "new" language comes up.<br />
            Besides programming I'm interested in data science, economics and all kinds of sciences, I like to learn and develop new skills.

                Hello! Welcome to my site, this should serve as an extended resume, a more detailed look into my work. So <span class="cyan-text">About me</span> ...  I'm a 23 y.o guy from Hungary hopefully, a successful game developer in the future. My main strengths are problem-solving, creativity and logical thinking. My favorite part of software development is the designing part both on back and front end, thinking about how the software looks and runs. I am most experienced with C#, coming from game development in Unity, but I can learn fast if a "new" language comes up. Besides programming I'm interested in data science, economics and all kinds of sciences, I like to learn and develop new skills.
